## ✨ About

**The Novacene Ltd** is an innovation studio and research collective exploring the future of learning, governance, and emergent intelligence.  
Founded by **Kirstin Stevens**, The Novacene bridges the symbolic and the practical — translating ideas from verse, education, and AI ethics into working systems.

Our work spans from inclusive hybrid schools like **The Haven Academy** to the relational AI architectures of **EVE11** and **Verse-ality OS**.

> “Ethics as geometry. Coherence as currency. Consent as protocol.”  
> — *Stevens, 2025*
